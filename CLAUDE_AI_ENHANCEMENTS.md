## ðŸ“Š EXPECTED IMPACT

**Without AI:**

**With AI:**
- Instant analysis: < 10 seconds
- Catch subtle patterns
- Consistent professional reasoning
- Focus on high-priority items

**ROI:**
- Time saved: 30-60 min/day
- Better decisions: +5-10% win rate improvement
- Reduced stress: AI handles grunt work
- Cost: $7/month (nothing!)

---

## ðŸš€ GETTING STARTED

All AI features use the same pattern:

```python
from intelligence_and_strategies import ClaudeIntelligence

claude = ClaudeIntelligence()
response = claude._call_claude_api(
    prompt="Your detailed prompt here",
    max_tokens=200,
    temperature=0.3  # Lower = more consistent
)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use specific prompts with real data
- Ask for structured output (DECISION: / REASON:)
- Set appropriate temperature (0.3 for decisions, 0.7 for creative)
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Add fallback logic if AI fails
