# AlphaGEX Profit-Focused Enhancements

## 🎯 Three Major Upgrades for Profitability

### 1. ✅ Actual Expiration Dates (Not Just DTE Ranges!)

**Problem**: Strategies showed "7-14 DTE" but no actual dates
**Solution**: Real expiration dates for every strategy

**New Features**:
- ✅ Actual expiration dates (e.g., "Jan 26 (7 DTE)")
- ✅ Countdown timers showing time until expiration
- ✅ Color-coded by urgency (🔴 0-2 DTE, 🟡 3-7 DTE, 🟢 8-14 DTE, 🔵 15+ DTE)
- ✅ Weekly vs Monthly expiration types
- ✅ Automatic calculation based on options calendar (Fridays)

### 2. 🤖 SPY Paper Trader with Auto-Execution

**Problem**: Need to test strategies without risking real money
**Solution**: Full paper trading system with automated execution

**New Features**:
- ✅ Auto-execute high-confidence setups (70%+ by default)
- ✅ Automatic position management:
  - Close at 50%+ profit
  - Close at -30% stop loss
  - Close 1 DTE before expiration
  - Close on GEX regime flip
- ✅ Performance tracking:
  - Win rate
  - Total P&L
  - Best/worst trades
  - Average win/loss
- ✅ Capital management (default: $100k paper capital)
- ✅ Position sizing based on confidence
- ✅ Prevent duplicate positions in same strategy

**Configuration**:
```python
# In Paper Trader Settings:
- Enable Paper Trading: ON/OFF
- Auto-Execute: ON/OFF
- Capital: $100,000 (default)
- Min Confidence: 70% (only trade 70%+ setups)
- Max Position Size: 10% (max 10% capital per trade)
```

**Auto-Exit Conditions**:
1. **Profit Target**: +50% gain → Close automatically
2. **Stop Loss**: -30% loss → Close automatically
3. **Expiration**: 1 DTE remaining → Close automatically
4. **Thesis Invalidated**: GEX regime flip → Close automatically
5. **Early Profit**: +20% with 7+ DTE → Close automatically

**Files**: `paper_trader.py`, `paper_trading_dashboard.py`

### 3. 📊 Weekly Gamma Tracking & SPY Correlation

**Problem**: Need to understand gamma patterns throughout the week
**Solution**: Historical gamma database with SPY correlation

**New Features**:
- ✅ Store unlimited intraday snapshots (not just today)
- ✅ Daily gamma summaries (open, close, high, low, changes)
- ✅ Weekly trend analysis
- ✅ SPY correlation tracking for all symbols
- ✅ Intraday pattern detection:
  - Market open patterns (9:30 AM)
  - Lunch patterns (12:00 PM)
  - Market close patterns (3:00-4:00 PM)
- ✅ Identify best entry times based on historical patterns

**Why Track SPY**:
> 90% of stocks correlate with SPY, so tracking SPY gamma trends helps predict movement in QQQ, IWM, and individual stocks

**Correlation Analysis**:
- Daily correlation scores (-1.0 to +1.0)
- Price correlation (does stock move with SPY?)
- GEX correlation (does gamma change with SPY?)
- Strong correlation (>0.7) = trade in sync with SPY
- Weak correlation (<0.4) = trade independently

**Files**: `gamma_tracking_database.py`, updated `intraday_tracking.py`

## 🎮 How To Use

### Using Paper Trader:

1. **Go to "🤖 Paper Trader" tab**
2. **Click "Settings" subtab**:
   - Enable Paper Trading: ✅
   - Auto-Execute: ✅
   - Set capital: $100,000
   - Min confidence: 70%
3. **System will automatically**:

   - Track performance

4. **View Performance**:
   - Win Rate (target: 75%+)
   - Total P&L

### Using Gamma Tracking:

1. **Auto-capture** (recommended):
   - Happens automatically when you "Refresh Symbol"
   - Snapshots stored in database
   - Daily summaries calculated

2. **Manual capture**:
   - Go to "📅 Gamma Tracking" tab
   - Click "📸 Capture Snapshot"
   - Do this 3-5 times per day for best patterns

3. **View Weekly Trends**:
   - See how GEX changes day-over-day
   - Identify bullish/bearish trends
   - Spot regime changes early

4. **Check SPY Correlation** (for non-SPY symbols):
   - See if symbol moves with SPY
   - High correlation (>0.7) = trade SPY setups on this symbol
   - Low correlation (<0.4) = trade independently

### Using Expiration Dates:

**Automatic!** All strategy setups now show:
- Exact expiration date (e.g., "Jan 26")
- Days to expiration (e.g., "7 DTE")
- Time until expiration (e.g., "6d 14h")
- Type (Weekly, Monthly, etc.)
